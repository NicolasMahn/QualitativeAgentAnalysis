How does the level of education relate to the Payment Tier? (Assume higher degrees like Master's or PhD represent 'better' education compared to Bachelor's. Please state any assumptions made about categorizing education levels).\n2.  Create a Plotly Dash dashboard to visualize this relationship. Consider using visualizations like box plots showing the distribution of Payment Tiers for each education category, or a bar chart showing the average/median Payment Tier per education category."
