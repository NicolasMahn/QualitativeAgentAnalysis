        "text": "<response><![CDATA[\nHere\u2019s the complete answer to your three follow-up questions, plus an updated Dash app that combines all analyses:\n\n1. Experience in Current Domain vs. Payment Tier  \n   \u2022 I grouped PaymentTier by each year of ExperienceInCurrentDomain and found the means hover between ~2.63\u20132.71 (medians all 3.0).  \n   \u2022 The Pearson correlation is only **0.018**, essentially zero.  \n   **Interpretation**: Years of experience have no meaningful linear relationship with pay tier\u2014PaymentTier stays flat across experience levels.\n\n2. Education vs. Payment Tier, controlling for Experience  \n   \u2022 Fitted a linear model with `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression` on one-hot(Education) + ExperienceInCurrentDomain.  \n   **Coefficients**:  \n     \u2013 Intercept \u2248 2.632  \n     \u2013 Experience \u03b2\u2081 \u2248 +0.0061 per year (nearly zero)  \n     \u2013 Bachelors \u03b2\u2082 \u2248 +0.1031  \n     \u2013 Masters \u03b2\u2083 \u2248 \u20130.1848  \n     \u2013 PHD \u03b2\u2084 \u2248 +0.0818  \n   \u2022 At the dataset\u2019s mean experience (~3.5 years), the **adjusted mean** PaymentTier by Education is:  \n     \u2013 Other \u2192 2.65  \n     \u2013 Bachelors \u2192 2.65  \n     \u2013 Masters \u2192 2.47  (lowest)  \n     \u2013 PHD \u2192 2.73      (highest)  \n   **Interpretation**: After accounting for experience, Master\u2019s holders occupy slightly **lower** tiers, PhD holders the **highest**, and Bachelor\u2019s/Others fall in between.\n\n3. Updated Plotly Dash Dashboard  \n   Copy the code below into a file (`dashboard.py`) next to your `Employee.csv` (with \u201cPHD\u201d spelling), then run `python dashboard.py` and open the local URL in your browser. This app displays:  \n   a) Raw box-plot & grouped bar-chart of PaymentTier vs. Education  \n   b) Scatter plot of PaymentTier vs. ExperienceInCurrentDomain  \n   c) Bar chart of **adjusted** mean PaymentTier by Education at mean experience  \n\n```python\nimport dash\nfrom dash import html, dcc\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n\n# 1.
