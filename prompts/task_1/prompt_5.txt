Update the employee attrition prediction dashboard created in the previous step.

1. Add a component (e.g., a chart or table) that helps interpret the prediction for the *currently inputted employee*. Show *local* feature importance, highlighting which input features contributed most significantly (positively or negatively) to the predicted probability of leaving for that specific case (e.g., using SHAP or LIME).
2. Integrate this explanation clearly alongside the prediction output in the dashboard interface.
