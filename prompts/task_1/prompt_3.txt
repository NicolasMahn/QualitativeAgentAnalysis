Create a *new* dashboard using the employee dataset to analyze gender distribution.

1. What is the overall gender distribution within the workforce?
2. How does the gender distribution vary across different 'City' locations?
3. Create a Plotly Dash dashboard visualizing these findings. Use appropriate charts, such as a pie chart for the overall distribution and grouped or stacked bar charts to compare distributions across cities.
