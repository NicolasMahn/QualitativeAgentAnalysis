Update the dimensionality reduction dashboard created previously (using 'student_habits_performance.csv') to include clustering capabilities.

1. Add functionality to perform clustering. Clustering is to be done on the original preprocessed features.
2. Allow the user to select a clustering algorithm from a list (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering) and input necessary parameters (e.g., number of clusters 'k' for K-Means).
3. Update the interactive 2D scatter plot (which shows the dimensionally reduced data) so that the user can choose how the points are colored:
    - Color by the cluster labels generated by the selected clustering algorithm applied to the original features.
    - Color by the values of any other selected attribute from the original dataset (e.g., `gender`, `part_time_job`, `diet_quality`, `internet_quality`, `parental_education_level`).
