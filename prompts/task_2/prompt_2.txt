Create a *new* dashboard for exploring the 'student_habits_performance.csv' dataset using dimensionality reduction (DR).

1. Select relevant features for DR.
2. Perform dimensionality reduction (reducing to 2 dimensions for visualization) on the preprocessed features.
3. Allow the user to select the DR method from a list of common options (e.g., PCA, t-SNE, UMAP).
4. Create a Plotly Dash dashboard featuring an interactive 2D scatter plot visualizing the results of the chosen DR method. Allow points to be colored initially by `gender`.
